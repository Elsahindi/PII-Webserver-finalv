# PII-Webserver-finalv
This is a simple static web server project that allows you to serve static files over HTTP. This web server is written in Python and can be run on any platform that supports Python.




The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple solution for serving static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files over HTTP. The web server is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a great solution for small projects or personal use.

The web server uses the built-in Python HTTP server module to handle incoming requests and serves static files from a specified directory. The user can specify the port number and the directory to serve files from, making it easy to customize the server for specific needs.

This project is open-source and available on GitHub for anyone to use and modify. Contributions are welcome and encouraged, as this project is designed to be a community-driven solution for serving static files over HTTP.
